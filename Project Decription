Spliteasy app is the easiest way to share expenses among a group of people. The 
app takes input form the users and performs the necessary calculations to display 
the result.
In todayâ€™s era, due to online payments and cashless transactions, if a group of 
people have to pay for some transaction, only one or two people in the group 
make the payment. Other people calculate their contribution later and pay back the 
amount they owe. This app fetches data for all users and all transactions and 
calculates the exact amount to be paid or received, thus making splitting of bills 
and sharing of expenses easier. We have created a basic version of this app which 
can be developed on a large and more complex scale.


-> Working
The program is designed in such a way 
that it takes input from users for their 
names , amount spent by each user for 
each transaction , etc. It then calculates 
the average that is contribution for each 
person and the total amount spent by 
each person. The respective difference 
between these two is how much each 
involved person owes.

1. Total number of users
2. Names of the users
